* In this paper, we exploit the Self Supervision based learning by introducing an Auto-encoder based pretext method to boost feature learning using the more commonly available under-sampled MR data.
* Our experiments using different deep-learning-based reconstruction models (dAutomap, U-net, W-net) in a low data regime demonstrate that self-supervision ensures stable training and improves MR image reconstruction.
